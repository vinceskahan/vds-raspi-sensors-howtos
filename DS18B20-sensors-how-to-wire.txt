# note: sensor will get 'very' hot if you get the power/ground reversed
#
# modprobe w1-gpio and w1-therm (or add to /etc/modules)
#      should see a /sys/bus/w1/devices/<ID_NUMBER> tree
#      id number is the unique serial number for that particular sensor
#      cat out the w1_slave file under that tree for the info, it will
#             contain something ala 25123 meaning 25.123 C
#      first line indicates whether the data is good or not
#      the data might show a bogus value the first time it is read
#
#
# You can add more sensors ala row-H, aligning the three pins matching
# the other ones (VCC on 8, Data on 9, Ground on 10 in diagram above)
#
# Quick test on a pi model-B would use 3.3V for Power (pin-1) and 
# GPIO 7 (pin-4) for data and pin-6 for ground based on 
# http://pi4j.com/pins/model-b-rev2.html
#
# Add dtoverlay=w1-gpio to /boot/config.txt and add 'w1-gpio' and 'w1-therm' to
# /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf and reboot the pi so the 1-wire devices
# appear on bootup.
