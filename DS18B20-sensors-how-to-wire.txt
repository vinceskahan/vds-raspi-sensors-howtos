# note: sensor will get 'very' hot if you get the power/ground reversed

# modprobe w1-gpio and w1-therm (or add to /etc/modules)
#      should see a /sys/bus/w1/devices/<ID_NUMBER> tree
#      id number is the unique serial number for that particular sensor
#      cat out the w1_slave file under that tree for the info, it will
#             contain something ala 25123 meaning 25.123 C
#      first line indicates whether the data is good or not
#      the data might show a bogus value the first time it is read
