# on the DS18B20 that I have, with the flat side toward from you,
#   left pin = GROUND, center = DATA, right = VCC
#
# note: sensor will get 'very' hot if you get the power/ground reversed
#
# modprobe w1-gpio and w1-therm (or add to /etc/modules)
#   * you should see a /sys/bus/w1/devices/<ID_NUMBER> tree
#   * the id number is the unique serial number for that particular sensor
#   * cat out the w1_slave file under that tree for the info, it will
#           contain something ala 25123 meaning 25.123 C
#   * the first line indicates whether the data is good or not
#   * the data might show a bogus value the first time it is read
#
# one resistor for multiple DS18B20 sensors is fine
#
# Quick test on a pi model-B would use:
#       3.3V   (pi pin-1)
#       GPIO 7 (pi pin-4) for data
#       GROUND (pi pin-6)
# based on http://pi4j.com/pins/model-b-rev2.html
#
# to make the 1-wire devices appear on bootup:
#    * add dtoverlay=w1-gpio to /boot/config.txt
#    * add 'w1-gpio' and 'w1-therm' to /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
#    * reboot the pi as a last test that the sensors appear on bootup.
